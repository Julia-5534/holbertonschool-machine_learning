<b>TIME SERIES FORECASTING</b>
<br>
<br><b>Learning Objectives</b>
<br>- What is time series forecasting?
<br>- What is a stationary process?
<br>- What is a sliding window?
<br>- How to preprocess time series data
<br>- How to create a data pipeline in tensorflow for time series data
<br>- How to perform time series forecasting with RNNs in tensorflow
<br>
<br><b>Requirements</b>
<br>- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
<br>- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)
<br>- Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.15), tensorflow (version 2.4.1) and pandas (version 1.1.5)
<br>- All your files should end with a new line
<br>- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
<br>- All of your files must be executable
<br>- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
<br>- Your code should follow the pycodestyle style (version 2.4)
<br>- All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
<br>- All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
<br>- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
